üöÄ EcZachly Inc. Full-stack engineering bootcamp homework
==============================

Welcome to the Full-stack bootcamp Template Repo! This repository serves as the central hub for organizing and submitting your weekly assignments in our boot camp.

## Getting Started

### Step 1. Copy the Repository Template:
- To initiate your homework repository, click the "Use this template" button. 
- Adjust the owner to your personal GitHub account and update the repository name to include your Discord username. 
- Opt for the "Private" option to create a private repository on your GitHub account.

### Step 2. Add Dan to your repo:
- Add Dan (https://github.com/thedewpoint) as a Collaborator in the private homework repo you just created on your GitHub account. To do this, go to Settings &rarr; Access &rarr; Collaborators &rarr; Manage Access. 


### Step 3. Submit Your Assignment via Pull Request (PR) for Review:
- **Separate PRs for Each Assignment:**
   - Please open a new, separate PR for each homework assignment. Even though the template contains multiple assignments within the same repository, each assignment needs to have a separate PR that the TAs/GAs can review.
   - **The branch associated with the PR should only contain changes related to the specific assignment you are submitting.** This is crucial to keep changes focused and make reviews more manageable.
- **Code Quality Matters:**
   - Before opening a PR, ensure your code is complete, adheres to production standards, and runs without commented-out lines or non-functional code.
- **Craft a Thoughtful PR:**
   - When creating your PR, provide a detailed description. Explain the assignment's goal and your approach as if you were introducing an independent project to someone unfamiliar with the task.
- **Tagging for Review:**
   - Only after finalizing your code and adding a comprehensive PR description, tag all TA/GAs in a comment on the PR (specific to **one** assignment) for review.

>
> ‚≠ê **IMPORTANT:** We prioritize providing feedback for fully completed assignments. Please be considerate of the TA/GAs' time and refrain from requesting reviews for work-in-progress submissions. Your thoughtfulness is appreciated.

## üí° **Additional Information**

- **Collaboration:**
   - Choose to work on the homework individually or collaboratively with your camp-mates. 
   - If working with others, it's crucial that **each group member mentions their collaborators (tags or `@`s their GitHub username) in their README** (both parties need to mention each other). This is a preventive measure to identify and address any potential plagiarism.
- **Deadlines:**
	- Homework is typically due at 11:59PM PT on Fridays one week after the material is covered. Some deadlines have been extended due to the holiday season.
     - Please check the [schedule](https://fullstackexpert.io/bootcamp?mode=schedule) for exact dates. These deadlines are final and non-flexible.
   - Revisions are allowed until the deadline, but you should NOT open a PR and tag the TAs/GAs until you have a polished version of the code and descriptive PR. 
- **‚òï Exclusive Coffee Chats:**
   - To participate in the "Q&A " on Thursdays, homework must be submitted an hour before the Thursday session begins. 
   - You will need to complete the homework due that specific week, not the homework from the previous week. (Yes, this means we're asking for an **early** submission to qualify for the exclusive sessions with Zach & Dan.)

### üö® Important Reminders:
   - **DO NOT push your homework solutions or open a PR in the GitHub organization.**
   - **DO NOT create a new repo in the GitHub organization.**
   - A dedicated portal for submitting your homework link is under construction. For now, tag Dan in your prs in your personal repo
